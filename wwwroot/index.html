    <h3>Well, welcome to my 'lil site.</h3>

    <p>
        What I would like to get out of this IS 413 course. Well, I hope to become well versed in C#. It's true that the more programming languages you use,
        the more similar they all become, but it'd be great to feel comfortable in C#. I am also excited to learn to make ASP.NET Core Web Apps. It sounds
        totally foreign and intimidating for the moment, but I'm excited to get to the point where I feel comfortable doing it. Maybe I won't be a master,
        but I'll be comfortable. I enjoy doing all things web design (with a particular interest in the back end), so I am excited for that.
